## Part 2. Screen Reader Navigation Experience

### Navigating ESPN.com:
- **Easy Parts:**
  - I was able to find the "Top Headlines" section relatively quickly because I am already familiar with the ESPN website layout. As someone passionate about sports, I frequently visit ESPN, so I had an idea of where to look for the headlines, even without visually navigating.
- **Difficult Parts:**
  - Navigating solely with the screen reader was challenging because I am not used to this method of interaction. Moving between headings and links using the commands felt unintuitive at times, especially when trying to locate specific sections.

### Navigating WebAIM.org:
- **Easy Parts:**
  - None. Navigating WebAIM.org using the screen reader was unfamiliar and confusing.
- **Difficult Parts:**
  - I was unable to locate the "Web Accessibility Virtual Training" page or the FAQ section to determine if the training is archived. The process felt difficult because I had no prior familiarity with the website and the structure wasn’t as clear or easy to follow using the screen reader.

### General Reflection:
- **Experience:**
  - Completing this task was both easy and hard at the same time. While the commands for skipping between headings and links were useful, I found the overall process challenging because I’m not accustomed to using a screen reader. This was a completely new experience for me, and it required a lot of focus and patience to understand how the navigation worked.
